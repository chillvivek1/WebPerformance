### Speed is a Feature

- Faster sites lead to better user engagement
- Faster sites lead to better user retension
- Faster sites lead to higher conversion

Critical components to determine performance over a network:
### Latency
Time taken for a packet from source to destination
### Bandwidth
Maximum throughput of a logical or physical communoication path
### Latancy is the bottelneck for web application performance  (TCP and HTTP protocols explains why!)

Total Latency between a client and a server is due to following delays:
### 1. Propagation Delay
Time required to travel between the source and distance

### 2. Transmission Delay
Time required to push all the data into the communication link

### 3. Processing Delay
Time required to process the packet header, check for bit-level errors and determine packet's destination

### 4. Queuing Delay
Waiting time for a packet before its processed.
